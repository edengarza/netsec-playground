# Network Security Playground
This repository is an open canvas to experiment with topics learned in CSCE 765 and to learn the Rust programming language.

## Projects
Each project is contained in a directory and being built as a library to easily include components as concepts build on each other.

Current directories include:
- `des` - Data Encryption Standard as specified in FIPS 46-3. While not the most secure, a good intro project to Rust and byte level manipulations
